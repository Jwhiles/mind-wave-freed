  <h2>Why does early intervention matter</h2>
  <div class="early-intervention-speech-bubble">
    <p>
      The less time a person has spent being ill, the more effective treatment seems to be. This is most true during adolescence and young adulthood.
      People with eating disorders experience changes to their brain, body and behaviour. In the early stages these changes are more easily reversed. This means that with early treatment there is a better chance of a full recovery.
