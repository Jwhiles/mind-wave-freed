      <strong>You donâ€™t have to face this alone.</strong> Eating disorders can be hard to deal with on your own. We want you to get as much help as you can. That said, we know that reaching out can be hard. You might not know where to get support or how to take the first steps.
      This page is our guide to seeking support.

    <p>
      It can be really hard to reach out for help. It is normal to feel strong feelings like anxiety, embarrassment or shame. We understand that feelings like these can get in the way of talking about eating difficulties.
